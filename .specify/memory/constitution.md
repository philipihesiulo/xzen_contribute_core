# Xzen Contribute Core Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to high standards of clarity, maintainability, and style. Code should be self-documenting, and comments should be used to explain the *why*, not the *what*. All code must pass automated linting and style checks before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is non-negotiable. All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by unit and integration tests. Critical user flows must be covered by end-to-end tests. Code coverage metrics will be monitored and must not decrease.

### III. Dependency Management
The project must use the latest stable versions of all libraries, frameworks, and dependencies. A regular process for reviewing and updating dependencies must be followed to ensure security and access to new features.

### IV. Security First
Security is a primary design constraint. All development must follow security best practices, including but not limited to, input validation, output encoding, and secure handling of credentials. Dependencies must be scanned for known vulnerabilities.

### V. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All user-facing components and workflows must adhere to the established design system and UI guidelines.

### VI. Performance Requirements
The application must be performant and responsive. Performance budgets must be defined for critical user interactions, and all new code must be written to meet these targets. Performance testing should be integrated into the development and release process.

## Development Standards

This section outlines the technical standards and practices that all contributors must follow. These are derived from the core principles and are intended to provide actionable guidance.

- **Code Style**: Adhere to the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- **Branching**: Follow the GitFlow branching model. `main` is for production releases, `develop` is for active development, and features are developed in `feature/` branches.
- **Commits**: Commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- **Pull Requests**: All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. All CI checks must pass.

## Governance and Compliance

This section defines the rules for the constitution itself and the process for ensuring compliance.

The constitution is the highest authority on development practices for this project. It can only be amended through a formal proposal and review process. All contributors are expected to understand and adhere to the principles and rules outlined in this document.
